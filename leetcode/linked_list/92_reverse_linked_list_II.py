'''
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, 
reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
