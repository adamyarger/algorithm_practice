# 3

- should be submitable in form (attatchAttributes)
- attachInternals
- only allow 0-9 check number on input
- advance to next
- delete go back
- flex box with gap 38px height width center text 16px size



### Thing i forgot
- attacchAttributes
- adopt value from input with getter and setter
- no need for custom event, just listen for input
- if you need custom event, emit it from the component
