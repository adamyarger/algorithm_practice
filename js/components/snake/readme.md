# todo
JUST make it work the first time. then refactor ii design

- split the game up into parts
- game play. start, end 

### how does the ui get updated?


### get the snale moving
- move
    - setinterval update active, tie to grid 
    - 2d arr or single arr with modulus?
- init snake
- how to turn?



## notes 2
- games are different, they have a routine where
  we update state on each new iteration (frame)
- https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html

LOOP
- process input -> update game -> render



- handle user inputs
- handle apple spwan better
  - make an array of all available cells
  - then do rand to choose index of available cells


NEXT ROUND
- only do the hard parts over again
- is out of bounds
- cretae apple
- update snake
