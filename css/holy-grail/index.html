            <h1>Holy Grail</h1>
            <p>At its core, the Holy Grail Layout is a page with a header, footer, and three columns. The center column
                contains the
                main content, and the left and right columns contain supplemental content like ads or navigation.

                Most CSS solutions to this problem aim to meet a few goals:

                They should have a fluid center with fixed-width sidebars.
                The center column (main content) should appear first in the HTML source.
                All columns should be the same height, regardless of which column is actually the tallest.
                They should require minimal markup.
                The footer should “stick” to the bottom of the page when content is sparse.
                Unfortunately, because of the nature of these goals and the original limitations of CSS, none of the
                classic
                solutions
                to this problem were ever able to satisfy all of them.

                With Flexbox, a complete solution is finally possible.</p>
